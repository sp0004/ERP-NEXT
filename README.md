What is an ERP system ?
ERP is an acronym for Enterprise Resource Planning.  ERP software integrates these various functions into one complete system 
to streamline processes and information across the entire organization.
The central feature of all ERP systems is a shared database that supports multiple functions used by different business units. 
In practice, this means that employees in different divisions—for example, accounting and sales—can rely on the same information 
for their specific needs.
Other common ERP features include a portal or dashboard to enable employees to quickly understand the business' performance on key metrics
